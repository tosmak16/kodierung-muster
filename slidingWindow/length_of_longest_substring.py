# Problem Statement
# Given a string with lowercase letters only, if you are allowed to replace no more than ‘k’ letters with any letter,
# find the length of the longest substring having the same letters after replacement.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: String="aabccbb", k=2
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Replace the two 'c' with 'b' to have a longest repeating substring "bbbbb".
# Example 2:
#
# Input: String="abbcb", k=1
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the 'c' with 'b' to have a longest repeating substring "bbbb".
# Example 3:
#
# Input: String="abccde", k=1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Replace the 'b' or 'd' with 'c' to have the longest repeating substring "ccc".


def length_of_longest_substring(str, k):
    window_start, max_length, max_repeat_letter_count = 0, 0, 0
    frequency_map = {}

    # Try to extend the range [window_start, window_end]

    for window_end in range(len(str)):
        right_char = str[window_end]
        if right_char not in frequency_map:
            frequency_map[right_char] = 0
        frequency_map[right_char] += 1
        max_repeat_letter_count = max(max_repeat_letter_count, frequency_map[right_char])

    # Current window size is from window_start to window_end, overall we have a letter which is
    # repeating 'max_repeat_letter_count' times, this means we can have a window which has one letter
    # repeating 'max_repeat_letter_count' times and the remaining letters we should replace.
    # if the remaining letters are more than 'k', it is the time to shrink the window as we
    # are not allowed to replace more than 'k' letters
        if (window_end - window_start + 1 - max_repeat_letter_count) > k:
            left_char = str[window_start]
            frequency_map[left_char] -= 1
            window_start += 1
        max_length = max(max_length, window_end - window_start + 1)
    return max_length
